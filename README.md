# CORIDC-ARM
ARM assembly with C associated code that implements the CORDIC algorithm for calculating sine.

This project was written for COMPE-271 at San Diego State University. This is an implementation of an ARM function that is called in C, accepts an 32 bit integer angle, and returns the sine of the number in floating-point format. Additional explanation of the function is given in the project report document, and the shortcomings are also discussed in the report.
